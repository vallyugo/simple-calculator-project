#INTRODUCTION
A project on building a simple calculator using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
For this project, no framework was used.
#Notes
1. The last mathematical operator would be taken when two or more maths operator occurs together.
2. Repeation of dots(.) for decimal numbers was checked and avoided.
3. javaScript inbuild function eval() was used to run the calculations any time = button is pressed.

#Modification
For modification purposes, 
1. dots (.) would still output although not repeatdedly but within a single float number
example 1...... would not exist but 11.1.11. would.
